# Hash Table Implementation in C

## Description

This project is an implementation of a hash table in C, following the tutorial provided by [James Routley&#39;s Write a Hash Table](https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table/). The hash table data structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs using a hashing algorithm.

## Features

- **Hashing Algorithm:** The project uses a hash function to convert keys into indices for the hash table array.
- **Insertion and Retrieval:** The hash table supports inserting key-value pairs and retrieving values using keys.

## Tutorial Source

This implementation follows the tutorial from [James Routley&#39;s Write a Hash Table](https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table/), which provides an in-depth explanation of hash tables and their implementation.
