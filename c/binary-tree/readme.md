# Binary Tree

This project is a dive into the world of binary trees using the C programming language. Through the implementation of fundamental commands (add, max, search, print, and quit), this project provides an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of binary tree structures and their associated operations.

## Motivation

While this project wasn't initially planned for this repository, the idea to work on it came from a friend's suggestion. Exploring binary trees provides an excellent opportunity to deepen your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and memory management within the context of the C programming language.


## Usage

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Compile the C source files using a C compiler, e.g., `gcc`.
3. Run the compiled executable to interact with the implemented commands.
4. Launch the program.
5. Enter the desired command (add, max, search, print, or quit).
6. Follow the prompts and provide inputs as required by each command.
7. Observe the results and explore the behavior of the binary tree commands.
